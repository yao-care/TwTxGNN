# TwTxGNN: AI-Powered Drug Repurposing for Taiwan NHI Drugs

## Executive Summary

**TwTxGNN** is an open-source drug repurposing platform that leverages Harvard's TxGNN deep learning model to predict potential new indications for Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) approved drugs. Unlike prediction-only tools, TwTxGNN provides a complete evidence validation pipeline, integrating clinical trials, literature, and safety data to generate actionable reports.

## Key Differentiators

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Evidence-Based Predictions** | Every prediction is validated against ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and other authoritative sources |
| **Five-Level Evidence Classification** | L1 (multiple Phase 3 RCTs) to L5 (AI prediction only) |
| **SMART on FHIR Integration** | Ready-to-use app for EHR integration |
| **FHIR R4 API** | Static FHIR resources for external system integration |
| **Comprehensive Safety Data** | 222,391 DDI records, 8,359 DDSI records |

---

## Data Overview

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Drug Reports | 191 |
| Drug Repurposing Candidates | 142,328 |
| Predicted Indications | 1,268 |
| Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) | 222,391 |
| Drug-Disease Contraindications (DDSI) | 8,359 |

### Evidence Distribution

| Level | Definition | Drug Count |
|-------|------------|------------|
| L1 | Multiple Phase 3 RCTs | 6 |
| L2 | Single RCT or Phase 2 trials | 12 |
| L3 | Observational studies | 16 |
| L4 | Preclinical / mechanistic | 19 |
| L5 | AI prediction only | 138 |

## SMART on FHIR Integration

TwTxGNN provides a fully functional SMART on FHIR application that can be integrated into any FHIR R4-compliant EHR system.

### Capabilities

1. **Patient Medication Retrieval**: Reads MedicationRequest/MedicationStatement from EHR
2. **Drug Mapping**: Maps RxNorm codes to TwTxGNN database via RxNorm API
3. **Repurposing Lookup**: Displays predicted new indications for each medication
4. **Evidence Display**: Shows evidence level and supporting references
